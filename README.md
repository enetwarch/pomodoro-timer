# Pomodoro Timer

This is a Pomodoro Timer that I built as a small project for practicing **JavaScript fundamentals**. It's designed to improve focus and productivity using the **Pomodoro Technique**. Only the Pomodoro state, timer, and session are indicated in the output to maintain a minimalistic look.

* **Reset**: Shows a prompt asking how the user wants to reset.
    * **Soft Reset**: This only reset your current timer.
    * **Hard Reset**: This resets your timer, session, and state.
* **Play/Pause**: Toggles the timer.
    * Pressing the **Space** button in your keyboard also triggers this button.
* **Settings**: Allows the user to customize the timer to their liking. The default setting is as follows:
    * Work Minutes: 25 minutes
    * Rest Minutes: 5 minutes
    * Long Break Minutes: 15 minutes
    * Long Break Intervals: 4
