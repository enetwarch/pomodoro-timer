# [Pomodoro Timer](https://enetwarch.github.io/pomodoro-timer/)

This is a Pomodoro Timer that I built as a small project for practicing **JavaScript fundamentals**. It's designed to improve focus and productivity using the **Pomodoro Technique**. Only the Pomodoro state, timer, and session are indicated in the output to maintain a minimalistic look.

* **Reset**
    * **Tapping**: this button will display a confirmation asking if the user wants to **soft reset** the timer. 
    * **Holding**: will ask a **HARD reset** which resets the state, session, and timer based on the settings.
* **Play/Pause** 
    * **Tapping** this button will toggle the timer and dynamically set the icon to play or pause. Pressing the **space button** in your keyboard also triggers this button.
* **Settings**: Allows the user to customize the timer to their liking. The default setting is as follows:
    * Work Minutes: 25 minutes
    * Rest Minutes: 5 minutes
    * Long Break Minutes: 15 minutes
    * Long Break Intervals: 4

### Tech Stack
